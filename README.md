> *Zero overhead. Zero bloat. Zero compromise.*

## What is Rae?

Rae is a modern C++ framework for building graphics applications, tools, editors, and visualizations. The name embodies the philosophy: **RAII** (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), **Ray** (light, direction, and rendering), and **Rei** (é›¶ - Japanese for zero).

## The Goal

Create a clean, extensible framework that leverages the latest C++23 features while maintaining an understandable architecture. Rae aims to be both a practical foundation for real applications and a reference for modern C++ design patterns.

## What's Inside

Rae is built around a pluggable graphics backend system, starting with SDL3 for cross-platform windowing and rendering. The framework uses RAII principles throughout for automatic resource management, and includes ImGui with docking support for building developer tools and UI. EnTT provides the entity-component-system architecture, spdlog handles async logging, and GLM powers the math operations.

The design emphasizes clean separation of concerns with a layer-based application structure for organizing code.

## Status

ðŸš§ **In Active Development** - Core architecture and systems are being implemented.
